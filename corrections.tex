\begin{enumerate}

\section{Chapter 1}

\item{\corr{Hypothesis} Please include whether there are overarching hypotheses guiding the
proposed research.

\resp{A short discussion of overarching questions has been added to
  the introduction.}{Hypothesis} }

\item{\corr{Alignment} Please include a discussion of statistical approaches to alignment
that might also be gainfully used to address the issue of misalignment
in selection analyses. You mentioned the use of FSA and BaliPhy during
the viva; can you comment why such approaches were not used (e.g.\ for
computational reasons)?

\resp{A discussion of misalignment and statistical alignment in
  selection analyses has been added as a new section to the
  introduction.}{Alignment} }

\section{Chapter 2}
\item{\corr{Pipeline} Please describe more regarding the technical details of the analytical
pipeline; how it was implemented (language etc.), how it integrates
into ENSEMBL, how jobs were distributed etc. As the construction of
this pipeline is the main methodological contribution of this thesis,
it is important to include details to demonstrate your role.

\resp{A subsection has been added which provides some details on the
  framework used for simulations and analysis throughout the
  thesis.}{Pipeline}
}

\item{\corr{Power} Please discuss why SLR had better power as (under a correctly
specified model) one would expect that adding distributional
assumptions, one would get a better power using the 'random effects'
approaches as implemented in PAML.

\resp{Further discussion has been added to the section describing the
  results of the simulation comparing the performance of SLR and
  PAML.}{Power}
}

\item{\corr{Overalignment} In general, how do you tell if an alignment is 'wrong'? Please also
clarify what 'overalignment' is.

\resp{Some elaboration on these details has been added to the
  Conclusions section.}{Overalignment}
}

\item{\corr{False Positives} Please explain in more detail why there is an increase in false
positives at intermediate levels of divergence in Figure 2.3.

\resp{The paragraph describing this artifact has been revised and expanded.}{False Positives}
}

\item{\corr{Applicability of Simulations} Please expand the discussion to consider how the results presented
here on mammalian genes (e.g.\ choice of aligner) may/may not be
applicable to other taxa such as viruses, expanding the comparison
with Privman et al.\ [2011].

\resp{Additional discussion has been added to the Conclusion section.}{Applicability of Simulations}
}

\section{Chapter 3}

\item{\corr{Large Trees} Why are there are significant number of trees with $>100$ sequences in
Figure 3.5?}

\section{Chapter 4}

\item{\corr{Synonymous Rate Variation} Sitewise variation in
  synonymous substitution rates is ubiquitous (see e.g. Kosakovsky
  Pond and Muse 2005,
  http://mbe.oxfordjournals.org/content/22/12/2375.full), yet all the
  methods employed assume no synonymous variation. Sites with
  unusually high synonymous rates (but with $\omega=1$) might be
  misclassified as under positive selection. To what extent are the
  results biased due to a failure to incorporate synonymous variation?
  Ideally, please present some goodness-of-fit tests to demonstrate
  that this is not a serious problem.}

\item{\corr{Duplicated Genes} Page 84; isn't the study of adaptive evolution in duplicated genes of
great biological interest?}

\item{\corr{Window Size} Please discuss the rationale for using 15 codon, nonoverlapping
windows to examine potential misalignments.}

\item{\corr{Impact of Filtering} Page 97. There is quite a strong impact of filtering on the results;
which are to be believed?}

\item{\corr{Terminal Versus Internal Branches} Comparison of patterns of substitution between terminal and internal
branches of a phylogeny was used as the basis for a test of adaptive
evolution by Kosakovsky Pond et al.\
(http://www.ploscompbiol.org/article/info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.0020062);
are there any such patterns here?}

\section{Chapter 5}

\item{\corr{P-values and Effect Sizes} Please discuss the advantages and disadvantages of using sitewise p
values rather than the effect sizes ($\omega$ and associated standard
errors) when conducting genomic level analyses. You may also want to
take a look at this paper
(http://mbe.oxfordjournals.org/content/27/3/520.abstract) which
describes an approach which uses the pattern of nonsynonymous and
synonymous rate variation as the basis of e.g.\ clustering. For the
corrections, and given that all the estimates of $\omega$ and associated
standard errors have already been produced, do the results of a
standard meta-analysis type approach based on effect size differ from
the p value based approach presented here?}

\item{\corr{Gene Annotation Bias} In table 5.2, there is a lot of redundancy in the gene lists
(e.g.\ SAMHD1, TLR1/4), partly due to the multiple GO terms associated
with these genes, which are mostly immune related. To what extent do
the same genes crop up again due to the large number of terms (as
opposed to their actual importance)?}

\item{\corr{Low PSG Overlap} Please discuss in more detail why there was so little overlap between
PSGs described in different studies, as shown in Figure 5.4.}

\section{Chapter 6}

\item{\corr{King Wilson Discussion} The discussion of King and Wilson's hypothesis should probably be
moved to the discussion section, as it is more of a distraction in the
introduction.}

\item{\corr{Model Misspecification} Please discuss the potential problem of model misspecification when
employing models that assume different models in different
branches. It is entirely possible that none of the prespecified models
in Figure 6.2 are the 'best', and hence any site-by-site models built
on top of these may also be compromised (see
http://mbe.oxfordjournals.org/content/28/11/3033.long for a further
discussion of this). Please consider a wider range of 'alternative'
models, and compare the goodness-of-fit with the prespecified ones.}

\item{\corr{Slightly Deleterious Polymorphism} What might the contribution of slightly deleterious polymorphisms be
to apparent accelerated evolution in humans?}

\item{\corr{Considering Polymorphisms} To what extent might the results differ if you had multiple genomes
per species? What might be the contribution of shared polymorphisms in
the ancestral species in driving apparent accelerations?}

\item{\corr{Relevance of dN/dS Differences} Please discuss the biological relevance of small (0.01--0.05)
differences in genome-wide dN/dS (Figure 6.5).}

\section{Chapter 7}

\item{Please expand the discussion to include issues such as:
  \begin{itemize}
  \item{The connection between the phylogenetic approaches used here
    and other population-genetic approaches. In particular, please
    comment on why there is an apparent discrepancy between these
    approaches in the proportion of sites under adaptive
    evolution. How does the finding of positive selection relate to
    change in phenotype/fitness, and its magnitude?}
  \item{Please comment on the limitations of the approaches used
    here--the restriction to analysis of coding regions, detection of
    particular types of selection, etc.}
  \item{Given that low-coverage genomes were used in the analysis,
    please comment on whether sequencing errors may have affected the
    results.}
  \end{itemize}
}
