\section{The degeneracy of the genetic code, \nsyn and \syn mutations, and $\omega$}

the degeneracy of the genetic
code results in divergent structural, functional and evolutionary
consequences for \syn and \nsyn mutations in gene-coding regions. The
rate at which the two types of mutations accumulate in a given gene
depends to a large extent on the magnitude of the individual selective
disadvantage incurred by structure- or function- altering \nsyn
mutations and the tendency of the evolving population to cause
differential fixation of mutations based on different levels of
selective advantage or disadvantage. Some \nsyn mutations would
completely disable a protein necessary for life, making offspring
harboring such mutations would be nonviable; in this case the
differential survival of those mutations is severe and immediate. In
many cases, however, protein-altering mutations do not have such a
drastic effect; rather, they
