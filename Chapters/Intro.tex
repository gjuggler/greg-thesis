Over the past decade, the comparative analysis of genomic sequences
has immeasurably expanded our understanding of the evoluion, biology
and diversity of mammals, the taxonomic class to which we belong.
%\citep{Lander2001,Mouse2002Initial,Rat2004Genome,LindbladToh2005Genome,
%  Sequencing2005a,Margulies2007}.
Although the revolution in genomic
medicine that was optimistically predicted during the unveiling of the
draft human genome sequence is still far from being realized
\citep{Collins2001,Varmus2010}, the impact of comparative genomics on
the study of human evolution, diversity and biology has been more
immediate, far-reaching and deep \citep{OBrien1999,Lander2011}. Many
important questions in evolution have been asked---for example, what
is the rate of mammalian speciation
\citep{BinindaEmonds2007,Venditti2011}, or what is the fraction of the
genome under functional constraint
\citep{Boffelli2003a,Siepel2005,Ponting2011}---and, to some extent
answered, using large amounts of genomic data.

The aim of this thesis is to show how the large-scale comparative
analysis of genes and genomes can be used to identify genomic regions
and biological features which have been subject to exceptional levels
of selective constraint throughout mammalian evolution. When shared
across many species, these evolutionary patterns of purifying and
positive selection can highlight genes and pathways involved in
ongoing, universal mammalian genetic conflicts related to host immune
defense and reproduction \citep{CastilloDavis2004}. On the other hand,
when strong selective pressures are observed in just one or a few
lineages, they may indicate more specific adaptations related to those
species' unique evolutionary hsitory
\citep{Messier1997,Sawyer2005a,Nielsen2007}.

Along with the increased use of high-throughput methods and datasets
in biology has come a heightened awareness of the inescapable presence
of noise and error within data. The study of genome sequences is no
exception to this point; indeed, the many potential sources of error
in any comparative genomic analysis combine to make it difficult to
assess accuracy or to identify anomalous results. This is especially
problematic in comparative genomic analyses, where genome sequencing
and sequence alignment errors can be mistaken for interesting
biological signals
\citep{Mallick2009,Schneider2009,Fletcher2010,MarkovaRaina2011}. Some
of the difficulty of assessing results stems from a limited
understanding of how various sources of error can impact downstream
evolutionary analyses; thus, a secondary aim of this thesis is to
contribute to our understanding of the impact of error on large-scale
comparative analyses and to further develop methods for appropriately
predicting and handling such error.

\section{The evolution of mammals and the mammalian genome}
\label{section_mammal_evolution}

A major motivating factor behind the sequencing and study of mammalian
genomes has been the desire to shed light on the human genome sequence
through comparative study, leading to a better understanding of the
diversity of genomic constraints under which our species has evolved
\citep{Mouse2002Initial}. As the genome sequence of every animal is
intertwined with all aspects of its biology, any comparison of genomes
must be performed within the context of each species' phenotypic
traits and evolutionary history. It will thus be useful to briefly
review some salient features of the evolutionary history of mammals
and their genomes which will serve as useful background for the
analyses presented in this thesis.

Mammals are a diverse class of vertebrates, comprising roughly 5,400
species whose common ancestor lived ca. 165--170 \ac{myr} ago
\citep{Wilson2005}. According to a comprehensive supertree constructed
by Bininda-Emonds et al. using a combination of molecular data and
fossil calibrations, the earliest major branching events were the
split of Monotremata (containing the egg-laying mammals such as
platypus and echidna) around 166 \ac{myr} ago and the divergence of
the Marsupialia and Placentialia orders around 150 \ac{myr} ago. By
100 \ac{myr} ago the major placental superorders (e.g., Afrotheria,
Euarchontoglires, Laurasiatheria and Xenarthra) had all diverged, and
nearly all extant mammalian orders originated prior to 85 \ac{myr} ago
\citep{BinindaEmonds2007}. These dates were somewhat earlier than what
had commonly been estimated based purely on fossil evidence
\citep{Archibald2001}, but the early mammalian fossil record is
sparse, which lends weight to the argument that the true date of
origin is several \ac{myr} before the earliest discovered
fossil. Taking this effect into account, an independent statistical
analysis of primate fossils provided corroborating evidence for the
relatively early divergence of mammalian lineages
\citep{Martin2007}. The Bininda-Emonds et al. phylogeny suggests that
43 placental lineages with extant descendants survived through the
mass extinction at the K/T boundary, when up to two-thirds of all
mammalian species went extinct \citep{Alroy1999}. Most mammalian
lineages experienced decreased diversification levels (i.e., lower
speciation rates) for 10 \ac{myr} after the K/T extinction event,
after which point they continued to diversify at a relatively constant
rate up to modern times \citep{BinindaEmonds2007,Martin2007}.

This evolutionary history has influenced the shape of the phylogenetic
tree relating the extant mammalian species, a summarized version of
which is shown in Figure \ref{fig_mammals_10k}. (Note that the dates
of some of the earliest branches of the phylogeny in Figure
\ref{fig_mammals_10k}, which was adapted from \citet{Haussler2009}
using data from \citet{Hedges2009}, disagree with the above
description based on \citet{BinindaEmonds2007}. This reflects the
large amount of uncertainty regarding the dates of the earliest
events.) Deep but relatively short branches separate most of the
ordinal groups, with the exception of Marsiupialia and Monotremata,
which are separated from the other mammalian orders by much longer
distances. Within each order, a fairly regular pattern of branching is
seen (but note that the phylogeny in Figure \ref{fig_mammals_10k} is
truncated at the family level, omitting the relationships of
individual species). Most orders are represented by several extant
species, suggesting that the branch length separating any one species
from its closest relative is fairly small, again with the exception of
Monotremata which contains only 5 species spanning 45 \ac{myr}. These
aspects of the mammalian phylogeny make it well-suited for large-scale
comparative analysis, as long evolutionary branches separating
sequences, which are a major source of alignment error and of
uncertainty in evolutionary estimates, can continue to be shortened by
sequencing additional species. Indeed, this was part of the motivation
behind the \ac{mgp} \citep{LindbladToh2011}, which generated much of
the data used throughout this thesis and which I will introduce in
more detail in Chapter \ref{ch_orthologs}.

  (e.g., there are 2,227 species of rodents). Figure taken from

\end{figure}

Before the K/T boundary, ancestral mammal and primate species were
likely smaller in size than they are today, as the ecological niches
for larger animals were occupied by dinosaurs
\citep{Martin2007,Smith2010}. Their diet is assumed to have been
largely insectivorous, as folivory in extant species is observed
mainly in larger mammals \citep{Smith2010} (but see \citet{Martin2007}
for an alternative perspective favoring a more folivorous primate
ancestor). After the K/T extinction event around 65 \ac{myr} ago,
mammals eventually diversified to occupy a wide range of the
ecological roles left vacant by extinct species, with many lineages
undergoing highly specialized morphological and behavioral adaptations
and the range of mammalian body sizes expanding by four orders of
magnitude \citep{Alroy1998}. A long-term trend towards larger body
sizes has been observed in many lineages; the hypothesis that this is
a general feature of mammalian evolution has been termed Cope's rule
\citep{Alroy1998}, though its universality is controversial
\citep{Finarelli2006,Monroe2010}.

The body size of mammals and their ancestors is an important
consideration in sequence analyses, as body size has been shown to
correlate with the overall rate of substitution in multicellular
eukaryotes
\citep{Mouse2002Initial,Hwang2004a,Welch2008,Galtier2009,Romiguier2010,
  Bromham2011}.  Other phenotypic features such as metabolic rate and
generation time have been similarly linked to genomic evolutionary
rates \citep{Martin1993,Nabholz2008}, but all three of these
characters are strongly cross-correlated in mammals, making it
difficult to isolate the effect of each particular variable on the
overall evolutionary rate or to identify the causative factor behind
such variation. Regardless, it is clear that extant mammals exhibit a
wide range of neutral evolutionary rates \citep{BinindaEmonds2007b},
with proposed explanatory factors including differences in the amount
of mutagenic free radicals associated with an animal's metabolic rate,
different rates of germ line cell divisions per year, and different
DNA repair control mechanisms \citep{Baer2007}.

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[scale=0.3]{Figs/mammals_29.pdf}
\caption{A phylogeny of 29 mammalian species, with branch lengths
  scaled with the neutral evolutionary rate estimated from genome-wide
  DNA alignments. Note the increased branch lengths of most rodent
  species (e.g., mouse, rat, pika) and various small members of
  Laurasiatheria (e.g., little brown bat, hedgehog, common shrew)
  relative to most primates (e.g., human, chimpanzee). Figure taken
  from \citet{LindbladToh2011}.}
\label{fig_mammals_29}
\end{figure}

The correlation between body size and neutral evolutionary rate has an
important consequence for comparative genomic studies in mammals:
extant species groups with smaller body sizes are expected to have
experienced more DNA substitutions since their common ancestor than
larger-bodied species groups, leading to increased branch lengths
within smaller-bodied clades when branches are scaled by the neutral
evolutionary rate. Figure \ref{fig_mammals_29} shows a phylogenetic
tree for 29 mammals scaled by the genome-wide rate of observed
substitutions, emphasizing the high observed substitution rates of
most rodents and low rates of most hominids and some larger-bodied
species from other mammalian orders. In comparative analyses where a
larger number of substitutions increases the power of a method to
detect a genomic feature or estimate an evolutionary rate (as is the
case for detecting conserved regulatory elements or
positively-selected genes), the larger branch lengths of
smaller-bodied species would be expected to result in improved power
and statistical accuracy. This effect will be especially important in
Chapter~\ref{ch_mammals1} where I compare \sw estimates of selection
pressures from groups of species from different mammalian orders.

A second biological characteristic showing significant variation
between mammals, the \ac{ne}, has important consequences for the study
of genomic regions subject to natural selection
\citep{Charlesworth2009}. \ac{ne} is a fundamental parameter in
population genetics, describing the size of an idealized population
that exhibits the same amount of dispersion of allele frequencies due
to genetic drift as the real population under study
\citep{Wright1931,Woolfit2009}. Many aspects of a population can
influence its \ac{ne}, including the census count, breeding patterns,
and geographical distribution of individuals \citep{Caballero1994},
and studies within mammals have consistently shown a much larger
\ac{ne} for rodents than for primates and for small versus large
mammals \citep{EyreWalker2002,Popadin2007,Halligan2010}, suggesting
that extant mammalian populations can significantly vary in this
parameter. It is beyond the scope of this thesis to provide a
comprehensive discussion of \ac{ne} and its importance within
population genetics and molecular evolution, but \citet{Woolfit2009}
and \citet{Charlesworth2009} provide focused reviews of the
subject. The main predicted impact of \ac{ne} on the study of fixed
substitutions between species is that slightly deleterious mutations
are more likely to become fixed within a population having a small
\ac{ne} versus a population with a large \ac{ne}. Closely tied to this
effect is the prediction of the nearly neutral thoery of molecular
evolution \citep{Kimura1985} that many mutations in protein-coding
regions are slightly deleterious and thus subject to this dependence
on \ac{ne} \citep{Kimura1974,Kimura1985,Ohta1992}. Several empirical
studies have supported this hypothesis, showing that a different
\ac{ne} leads to different rates of protein evolution in bacteria
\citep{Moran2008,Warnecke2011}, birds \citep{Axelsson2009} and mammals
\citep{Kosiol2008,Ellegren2009} (but see \citet{Bachtrog2008} for
potentially contradictory evidence from \emph{Drosophila}). Any
analysis of comparative evolution in mammals should thus evaluated
with respect to these well-established trends; in Chapters~
\ref{ch_mammals1} and~\ref{ch_mammals2} I consider the possible
effects of \ac{ne} on the observed patterns of positive selection
within different groups of mammals, and in Chapter~\ref{ch_gorilla} I
use genome-wide comparisons to estimate ancestral \ac{ne} in our
closest primate relatives.

Some key features of the mammalian genome itself are also worth
highlighting. Mammals contain relatively large genomes (containing
roughly 3 Gb of DNA, ranging from 2.5 to 4.5 Gb) with between 20 to 80
chromosomes \citep{Bachmann1972}. The large range in chromosome count
is likely a result of the high rate of chromosomal rearrangement in
mammals \citep{Eichler2003,Pevzner2003}. Some regions termed
``rearrangement hotspots'' show especially large amounts of
large-scale genomic shuffling within mammals, and it has been
speculated that these regions have contributed to the many
lineage-specific gene family expansions which are found in mammals
\citep{Eichler2003}. Breakpoints of mammalian chromosomal
rearrangements tend to occur near transposable elements
\citep{Zhao2009}, which are small DNA sequences capable of replicating
throughout the genome \citep{Lander2001}. Transposable elements, a
diverse class of sequence elements representing a variety of
transposition mechanisms and sequence characteristics, together
comprise roughly 45\% of DNA in the human genome and have contributed
signifciantly the ancient and ongoing evolution of mammalian genomes
\citep{Lander2001,Cordaux2009}.

In contrast to the rapid turnover of noncoding DNA and high rate of
genomic rearrangement observed in mammalian genomes, the
protein-coding gene complement appears to be less variable. Initial
estimates of roughly 30,000 protein-coding
\citep{Lander2001,Mouse2002Initial} genes in the human and mouse
genomes have been lowered based on accumulating functional and
phylogenetic evidence to roughly 21,000 genes \citep{Macaque2007}; the
most recent gene annotations from \ens \citep{Flicek2011} contain
20,599 human and 21,873 mouse ``known'' protein-coding genes. A
majority of these genes are shared between all mammals: human and
mouse share an estimated 80\% of genes in a ``one-to-one'' fashion,
meaning no apparent gene duplications or deletions occurred since the
common ancestor \citep{Mouse2002Initial}, and a wider group of mammals
including platypus show detectable orthologs (including genes with
duplications or deletions in one or more lineages) in 82\% of genes
\citep{Warren2008b}. Despite the relative consistency of the mammalian
protein-coding catalogue, features such as alternative splicing and
domain concatenations have been identified as potential contributors
to mammalian phenotypic complexity and diversity \citep{Lander2001}.

In any study of vertebrate protein-coding genes, the \ac{2r} of genome
duplication hypothesis looms large. Originally proposed by
\citet{Ohno1970}, the \ac{2r} hypothesis suggests that two
polyplidization events occurred during the early evolution of the
vertebrate common ancestor, explaining the observation that
vertebrates often have up to four homologs of invertebrate genes
\citep{Hokamp2003}. For three decades the veracity of the \ac{2r}
hypothesis was hotly debated \citep{McLysaght2002,Dehal2005}, but
analyses based on comparisons between whole-genome sequences of
several fish and basal chordates have repeatedly confirmed its
predictions \citep{Kasahara2007,Putnam2008b}. In addition to having
interesting implications for the evolution of the immune system and of
morphological diversity within vertebrates
\citep{Hughes1997,Hoffmann1999,Peer2009b}, the existence of ancient
genomic duplications can cause problems in the inference of homology
relationships between genes. Many of these aspects will be considered
in more detail in Chapter~\ref{ch_orthologs} when a set of mammalian
orthologs suitable for evolutionary analysis is identified.

\section{Models of sequence evolution}
\label{section_evolution_models}

The previous section described the major genomic and evolutionary
features of mammalian species. It is important to note that the
majority of those well-established observations were made by applying
mathematical models of sequence evolution to comparative genomics
data, which is now a standard analytical approach. This section
briefly introduces the methods and models of evolutionary analysis
which will be applied throughout the remaining chapters.

As the hereditary material of all free-living organisms, DNA
represents a record of the history of life on earth. When an
individual gives rise to offspring, special segments of DNA are
replicated and passed on to all its descendants; importantly, the
processes of DNA replication and repair are imperfect
\citep{Arnheim2009} and the resulting errors, called mutations, can be
passed on to successive generations if they occur in germline
cells. In addition to being a major source of the variation between
individuals invoked in Darwin's theory of natural selection
\citep{Darwin1859a}, mutations in DNA leave a molecular record of
evolutionary relationships and of the passage of time. The gradual
accumulation of mutations in DNA, commonly observed as differences in
DNA sequences between species at the same homologous location, can be
reasonably modeled using phylogenetic trees and Markov models of
sequence evolution \citep{Yang2006}.

The earliest observations that biological sequences tend to randomly
change over time were made from sequences of proteins, the main
molecules of cellular machinery comprised of amino acid units whose
arrangement is encoded in the DNA sequences of exons within genes. In
the early 1960s, Zuckerkandl and Pauling were analyzing the amino acid
sequences of hemoglobin genes from various species. They noted that
the number of changes between sequences from different species
corresponded well with the evolutionary distance those species based
on fossil evidence; this led them to hypothesize that evolution at a
molecular level may occur at a largely constant rate
\citep{Zuckerkandl1962,Morgan1998}. Zuckerkandl and Pauling continued
to explore the implications and applications of this ``molecular
evolutionary clock'' hypothesis, using hemoglobin and cytochrome C
sequences to estimate the date of human-gorilla divergence (at 11
million years) and to infer the protein sequences of mammalian
ancestors \citep{Zuckerkandl1965}. A wide variety of evolutionary
models have subsequently been developed to describe observed patterns
of amino acid and DNA substitutions. As this thesis is concerned
largely with the application of such methods, I will only briefly
summarize the key features of the more popular evolutionary models;
\citet{Yang2006} provides a comprehensive mathematical treatment of
the main models used in practice.

The simplest Markov model for DNA substitution, proposed by
\citet{Jukes1969a}, assumes that every nucleotide has the same rate of
changing into any other nucleotide. Although the assumption of equal
rates is a reasonable starting point for modeling a random process,
the mutation of a DNA base pair is a biochemical process (or rather, a
set of potentially many unobserved biochemical processes which all
produce the same class of observable result), making the existence of
biases towards or against certain types of mutations highly
plausible. This was quickly discovered to be the case: analysis of the
ever-increasing number of available biological DNA sequences showed
that in most datasets \emph{transitions}, defined as substitutions
between two pyrimidine nucleotides (e.g., T$\to$C or C$\to$T) or
between two purine nucleotides (e.g., A$\to$G or G$\to$A), are more
common than \emph{transversions}, defined as substitutions from a
purine to a pyrimidine or vice-versa. \citet{Kimura1980} thus proposed
a more complex model, called K80 or Kimura's two-parameter model,
which accounted for this bias. Specifically, K80 extends JC69 by
incorporating an additional parameter, $\kappa$, referred to as the
transition/transversion ratio, representing the ratio of the rate of
transition substitutions to the rate of transversion
substitutions. When $\kappa$ is greater than one, transitions occur at
a higher rate than transversions, providing a better fit to most
biological datasets \citep{Brown1982}. The $\kappa$ parameter of K80 a
prototypical example of the parametric approach to building
evolutionary models, whereby a parameter is introduced into the model
which allows for a commonly-violated assumption of the simpler model
to be relaxed. Note that the value of the parameter is not specified
in the model; rather, it must be provided or estimated from the data
on a case-by-case basis, usually by \ac{ml} estimation
\citep{Whelan2001}.

Several nucleotide models were subsequently described which relax
various assumptions of the JC69 and K80 models
\citep{Whelan2001,Yang2006}. One especially unrealistic feature of K80
is its symmetric nature (meaning that the rate of substitution from
one nucleotide to another is the same as the rate of the reverse
substitution, e.g. G$\to$C = C$\to$G). A symmetric DNA Markov chain
yields equal nucleotide frequencies when the substitution process
reaches equilibrium, meaning that any starting DNA sequence, if left
to evolve long enough under such a process, will end up with equal
nucleotide frequencies. In reality, many biological sequences contain
highly unequal nucleotide frequencies (owing to a variety of possible
selective or mutationsal biases), making it inappropriate to assume an
equal base composition \citep{Yang2006}. Thus, models such as FEL
\citep{Felsenstein1981a}, HKY \citep{Hasegawa1985} and TN93
\citep{Tamura1993} were developed to allow for various combinations of
unequal base frequencies and unequal transition/transversion
ratios. The most general reversible nucleotide model, REV, includes four
parameters describing the equilibrium nucleotide frequencies and six
rate parameters, one for each possible pair of substitutions
\citep{Tavare1986}.

In contrast to the primarily parametric DNA models, evolutionary
models for amino acids have generally been estimated empirically
\citep{Whelan2001}. The JTT \citep{Jones1992} and Dayhoff
\citep{Dayhoff1978} amino acid models, developed during the early days
of evolutionary sequence analysis, were estimated using
parsimony-based counting methods. The parsimony principle was first
used to infer phylogenetic trees and ancestral protein sequences from
each set of aligned proteins within a large database. Based on those
phylogenetic trees and ancestral sequences, the entries of the 20x20
amino acid substitution matrix were populated with counts of inferred
amino acid substitutions, and these counts were used to estimate
reversible Markov substitution models. More recently, empirical amino
acid models were estimated using \ac{ml} methods, which improved upon
a number of methodological deficiencies of the parsimony approach
\citep{Adachi1996,Whelan2001b}.

At this point it should be pointed out that a few important
assumptions are shared by all of the models already described, namely
that all sites within an alignment are (a) evolving independently of
one another, (b) evolving under the same evolutionary process and at
the same evolutionary rate, and (c) related by the same underlying
phylogenetic tree. These assumptions are clearly violated in many real
datasets, so I will briefly review the development of models which
relax them to various degrees.

Independence between sites is generally a difficult assumption to
relax for computational reasons \citep{Kosiol2006c}, but the
hypermutability of CpG dinucleotides within mammalian genomes (where
CpG denotes a C nucleotide followed by a G nucleotide, the ``p''
representing the phosphodiester bond separating nucleotides on the
same strand of a DNA molecule) has provided strong impetus to
incorporate at least a dinucleotide context into models for estimating
nucleotide substitution rates from large mammalian alignments
\citep{Blake1992,Hwang2004a,Siepel2004a}. CpG hypermutability results
from the methylation and subsequent deamination of the cytosine
nucleotide at CpG sites in most mammalian genomic DNA. Although all
cytosine nucleotides are prone to deamination (whether methylated or
not), cytosine deamination produces uracil, which is removed from DNA
strands by the enzyme uracil glycosylase, allowing for DNA repair
mechanisms to replace the original cytosine. On the other hand, the
deamination of 5-methylcytosine produces thymidine, which is not
efficiently repaired and results in frequent C$\to$T transitions
\citep{Ehrlich1982,Hwang2004a}. Context-dependent substitution models
have shown that CpG mutations are by far the dominant form of mutation
in mammalian genomes, and such models have also been essential for
studying the evolution of GC content and mammalian isochores
\citep{Duret2006,Duret2008}.

The assumption of a homogeneous evolutionary process acting across all
alignment sites is often violated in real datasets of all sequence
types \citep{Yang2006,Whelan2008}, and the development of methods
allowing for this assumption to be relaxed in the analysis of various
types of sequences has long been an area of active research. Most
studies have focused on across-site variation of a single parameter
such as the evolutionary rate
\citep{Uzzell1971,Yang1994c,Yang1996,Nielsen1998}, but more complex
types of heterogeneity, such as heterogeneity in the entire rate
matrix which describes the evolutionary process, have also been
explored \citep{Lartillot2004} . The approach generally taken for
variation of a single parameter is to describe the rate (or whichever
parameter is being modeled as varying across sites) for each site as a
random draw from a statistical distribution. In this way, the
mathematically convenient assumption of independence between sites is
upheld while sites are allowed to vary according to the parameter of
interest. The gamma distribution is commonly used for this purpose, as
it contains only one parameter if the mean rate is normalized to
1. This parameter, $\alpha$, is typically estimated from the data and
has a very clear interpretation: low values of $\alpha$ reflect a
L-shaped gamma distribution with a large amount of rate variation,
while high values of $\alpha$ reflect a bell-shaped distribution where
most sites have the average rate.

The final assumption of a single phylogenetic tree relating all sites
within a sequence has been less studied. Simulations have been used to
evaluate the potential impact of recombination
\citet{Anisimova2003,Shriner2003} and gene conversion
\citet{Casola2009} on the use of evolutionary codon models (introduced
in the next section) to detect positive selection, finding that
moderate levels of false positive occur when the assumption of a
single tree is violated. Simulations have also been used to estimate
the impact of recombination on reconstruction of ancestral sequences
\citep{Busto2010} and phylogeny inference \citep{Schierup2000}. In
virus genetics where recombination is commonly encountered, methods
have been developed to automate the identification and handling of
recombination events in evolutionary analyses \citep{Pond2006}. In
comparative genomic analyses of closely-related species, the tree
relating the species' sequences may vary across the genome due to
\ac{ils}. This is encountered in the analysis of great ape genes
presented in Chapter \ref{ch_gorilla}, where a simple filtering scheme
was used to remove sites potentially subject to \ac{ils}.

\section{Detecting purifying and positive selection in proteins}
\label{section_codon_models}

Proteins are functionally active as folded, structured amino acid
molecules, but the genes which encode them replicate and mutate as DNA
molecules. The connection between DNA and protein is mediated by the
genetic code, which describes how non-overlapping codons, or triplets
of nucleotides within the coding sequence of a protein-coding gene,
are translated by the ribosome and tRNA molecules into polymers of the
20 common amino acids. Since there are $4^3=64$ possible codons and
only 20 amino acids, the genetic code is degenerate (i.e., multiple
codons are translated into the same amino acid). This degeneracy is
concentrated in the third codon position, with many codons differing
by only their third nucleotide coding for the same amino acid, but
some degeneracy also exists in the first position. No codons differing
by their second nucleotide encode the same amino acid. Only two amino
acids, methionine and tryptophan, are encoded by just one codon, and
three codons are stop codons used to signal the end of the peptide
chain.

The degeneracy of the genetic code causes some changes on the DNA
level to be \syn, meaning they result in no change to the encoded
amino acid sequence, while others are \nsyn, meaning they result in an
altered protein sequence. The decoupled nature of the process of DNA
mutation, which is presumably ``unaware'' of the genetic code and
affects all nucleotides equally, and the process of natural selection,
which acts on phenotypes typically (but not exclusively) affected by
protein structure, suggests that a comparison of rates of \nsyn and
\syn substitution would allow the influence of natural selection
acting on a protein to be detected while inherently correcting for the
neutral mutation rate. Indeed, the potential of this approach was
noted by various researchers as soon as large-scale DNA sequencing
became practical \citep{Kimura1977,Jukes1979}, and the comparison of
the rate of \nsyn substitution ($d$N) and the rate of \syn
substitution ($d$S) has been a cornerstone of the evolutionary
analysis of proteins ever since \citep{Yang2006}. Various techniques
were historically used to estimate \dn and \ds \citep{Yang2000c}, but
most modern software is based on one of the two parametric Markov
models for coding sequence evolution independently proposed by
\citet{Goldman1994a} and \citet{Muse1994} or, when an empirical codon
model is desirable, a version of the model estimated by
\citet{Kosiol2007}.

Although the two parametric codon models differ in the details of how
nucleotide and codon frequencies are handled
\citep{Yang2000c,Bierne2003a}, they are similar in that each
incorporates a selection parameter $\omega$, representing the ratio of
\dn and \ds, into a Markov model of coding sequence evolution. The
$\omega$ parameter has a simple interpretation, namely that it
measures the ``the net effect of selection at the protein level''
\citep{Yang2000CodonSubstitution}. When $\omega=1$, natural selection
acts neither for nor against protein change, and the sequence is said
to be evolving neutrally; when $\omega<1$, selection acts to conserve
the protein sequence, exerting a so-called purifying selective
pressure; when $\omega>1$, selection acts to change the protein
sequence, exerting a so-called positive selective pressure. Within the
context of population genetics, the $\omega$ parameter can be linked
to $s$, the selective coefficient of an allele segregating in the
population \citep{Nielsen2003,Nielsen2005b,Kryazhimskiy2008}, with
$\omega>1$ corresponding to $s>0$ and $\omega<1$ corresponding to
$s<0$. This interpretation involves many assumptions, however, and has
found little practical use \citep{Nielsen2003,Nielsen2005b}.

For either of these Markov codon models, parameters (including
$\omega$, $\kappa$, and branch lengths for the model of
\citet{Goldman1994a}) can be numerically optimized for a given
alignment and phylogeny by \ac{ml} using Felsenstein's pruning
algorithm \citep{Felsenstein1981a,Goldman1994a,Yang2000c}. In their
initial description of the model, \citet{Goldman1994a} presented an
example modification to the model which allowed for heterogeneous
substitution rates across sites using an approach similar to that
described above for nucleotide models. Much subsequent work has been
focused on developing models allowing for variation of $\omega$ across
sites in the alignment
\citep{Nielsen1998,Yang2000CodonSubstitution,Yang2002,
  Wong2004,Yang2005Bayes,Massingham2005}, between branches in the tree
\citep{Yang1998a}, or both \citep{Yang2002b,Zhang2005}.  A detailed
account of these developments will not be presented here
(\citet{Anisimova2009} provide a comprehensive review of the
state-of-the-art in probabilistic codon models), but three codon-based
models in particular are used extensively throughout this thesis to
examine patterns of natural selection within mammalian proteins: the
branch model and sites models implemented in the \ac{paml} program by
Ziheng Yang \citep{Yang2007PAML} and the \ac{slr} method implemented
in the \ac{slr} program by Tim Massingham \citep{Massingham2005}. Each
of these models is introduced in more detail below.

\subsection{Branch and sites models in PAML}

For a long time, the $\omega$ ratio was almost always calculated as an
average value across an entire protein \citep{Sharp1997}. Functional
and structural constraints within a protein sequence might dominate
the gene-averaged signal of evolutionary constraint, however, even if
positive selection has acted on some portion of the protein. In some
cases, such as when the amount of computational power or data
available is limited, averaging $\omega$ across sites is a reasonable
compromise, but as computer and sequencing technologies rapidly
developed in the late 1990s, that compromise was becoming less
necessary and whole-gene estimates less justifiable. Whole-gene
$\omega$ estimates were shown to lack power \citep{Endo1996}, and
although ad-hoc analyses of $\omega$ within specific regions of proteins
were more sensitive \citep{Hughes1988}, they were limited to cases
where prior knowledge of the tertiary or domain structure of a protein
could be used to identify subsets of the protein for analysis.

As a statistically rigorous alternative, Ziheng Yang and collaborators
adopted a random sites approach to modeling variation of the $\omega$
ratio across sites for the PAML software. This implementation
typically favored modeling $\omega$ variation with a gamma or beta
distribution, discretized into a predefined number of site classes for
computational efficiency. To identify positive selection with
statistical confidence, a variety of \acp{lrt} were developed. The
\ac{lrt} is a widely-used technique which allows a specific hypothesis
to be tested by comparing the probabilistic fit, known as the
likelihood, of two nested models to a given dataset
\citep{Fisher1925}. (Two models are nested when one model is a special
case of the other, as is the case when one model is equivalent to the
other model with a parameter held at a fixed value.)  In the context
of detecting positive selection, the most effective \acp{lrt}
typically compare a model allowing for some variation of $\omega$, but
not allowing $\omega>1$, to a more complex model which allows for
$\omega>1$ (the former model being nested within the
latter). \citet{Nielsen1998} initially proposed a few simple \acp{lrt}
for detecting positive selection; these were further expanded and
evaluated by \citet{Yang2000CodonSubstitution}, and
\citet{Anisimova2001} performed extensive simulations assessing the
power and accuracy of these tests. The current release of PAML
recommends two \acp{lrt} for detecting positive selection acting at a
subset of sites within genes: \mbox{M2a--M1a} and \mbox{M8--M7} (see
Table 1 in \citet{Wong2004} for a complete description of each
model). PAML also implements a method for identifying which individual
sites show strong evidence for positive selection. This method, called
the Bayes Empirical Bayes method and described in
\citet{Yang2005Bayes}, calculates for each site an approximate
posterior probability that it has been subject to positive
selection. I evaluate the power of this method for detecting \sw
positive selection in Chapter \ref{ch_indels1}.

Codon models relaxing the assumption of a constant $\omega$ throughout
the branches of the tree, but not across sites, were also developed
and implemented in PAML \citep{Yang1998,Yang1998a}. Although these
models have received less attention and use than the branch-site
models which allow $\omega$ to vary across both sites and branches
\citep{Zhang2005}, they may be useful when branch lengths are small
and parameter estimation under the complex branch-site models is
difficult, or when variation of $\omega$ across sites is not of
interest. These models are used in Chapter \ref{ch_gorilla} to
construct a series of \acp{lrt} for detecting accelerated evolution
along specific branches of the great ape tree.

\subsection{The Sitewise Likelihood Ratio method}

In contrast to PAML's approach to site-specific evolutionary analysis,
where a \ac{lrt} for positive selection within a gene is first
performed and, subject to a significant \ac{lrt} result, \sw posterior
probabilities for positive selection are then inferred, the \ac{slr}
method \citep{Massingham2005} was specifically designed for the
sitewise estimation of purifying and positive selection. \ac{slr} is
based on an explicit Markov model of codon evolution similar to that
of \citet{Goldman1994a}. No assumptions are made regarding the
distribution of $\omega$ ratios within the alignment; instead, the
value of $\omega$ is considered to be an independent parameter at each
site. As the estimation of model parameters and calulation of
likelihood values to perform an exact \ac{lrt} at each site would
involve an expensive high-dimensional optimization, \ac{slr} uses two
approximations which greatly reduce the computational complexity:
first, common parameters are estimated under the M0 model
\citep{Yang2000CodonSubstitution} with one $\omega$ for all sites
instead of the more parameter-rich true null model, and second, the
\sw $\omega$ parameter is estimated independently at each site under
the simplifying assumption that each site's contribution to the common
parameters is minimal \citep{Massingham2005}. In practical terms,
\ac{slr} uses the common parameters and the alignment data at each
alignment site to calculate a sitewise statistic for non-neutral
evolution. This statistic is based on a likelihood-ratio test where
the null model is neutral evolution ($\omega=1$) and the alternative
model is either purifying or positive selection ($\omega<1$ or
$\omega>1$, respectively). The raw statistic measures the strength of
evidence for non-neutral evolution at each site, and the observed
statistic can be compared to its theoretical distribution under the
null model, \chisq, to identify sites with evidence for purifying or
positive selection at a desired significance threshold. Simulations
performed by \citet{Massingham2005} showed \ac{slr} to perform as well
as or better than PAML’s random sites models; Chapter \ref{ch_indels1}
provides further assessment of the power of the \ac{slr} method to
detect \sw positive selection under a wide range of conditions, and in
Chapters \ref{ch_mammals1} and \ref{ch_mammals2} I apply \ac{slr} on a
large scale to analyze genome-wide patterns of \sw positive selection
in mammals.

\section{Outline of the thesis}

This thesis describes three largely independent studies centered
around the theme of using codon models to analyze patterns of
selective constraint in mammalian genomes.

Chapter \ref{ch_indels1} describes a simulation study I conducted to
evaluate the impact of alignment error on detecting \sw positive
selection. The widespread adoption of powerful methods for sequence
analysis has been somewhat hampered by a lack of understanding of the
limitations of, and sources of error inherent within, those
methods. Without such knowledge, researchers could either avoid using
such methods for fear of producing misleading results, or blindly
apply such methods without regard for possible errors. Both paths have
been taken by others with respect to the issue of alignment error in
detecting positive selection. As a first step towards an improved
understanding of alignment error and its impact on downstream
evolutionary analyses, I performed a thorough examination of the
impact of alignment error by comparing different aligners, trees, and
methods for detecting positive selection. This work has been recently
published \citep{Jordan2011} and is presented in Chapter
\ref{ch_indels1} largely unmodified from its published form.

With whole-genome sequences quickly accruing in the databases at an
ever-increasing pace, I devoted a large part of my research effort
towards applying evolutionary codon models on a large scale to
mammalian and primate genomes. The rest of the thesis reflects this
focus, presenting two major empirical analyses. Chapters
\ref{ch_orthologs}, \ref{ch_mammals1} and \ref{ch_mammals2} describe
in three sections a genome-wide analysis of \sw selective pressures in
mammals that was performed in collaboration with the \acf{mgp}; a more
detailed description of the \acp{mgp} and my involvement in the
analysis is provided as a preface to Chapter \ref{ch_orthologs}. A
highly summarized version of the results of this analyses was recently
published \citep{LindbladToh2011}, but the version presented here
differs in that a more recent dataset was used and the methods and
results are described in considerably more detail. Particular
attention was paid to identifying (and in some cases ameliorating)
possible sources of error and to comparing the current results with
those from previous similar studies in the literature.

Chapter \ref{ch_gorilla} presents a more detailed survey of
genome-wide evolutionary patterns within a much more closely-related
group of mammals, the African great apes. This study was the result of
a collaboration with Stephen Montgomery and Nick Mundy as part of the
gorilla genome analysis group led by the Wellcome Trust Sanger
Institute, and a manuscript including the major results from our
analysis is currently under review. As a few aspects of the study
design and interpretation of results were performed by collaborators
as well as myself, those items which do not represent entirely my own
work are clearly indicated. As in the mammalian analysis, attention
was paid to assessing the potential impact of known and unknown
sources of error on the conclusions drawn. The short branches
separating the great apes meant that even small amounts of sequencing
error could yield incorrect results.

Finally, Chapter \ref{ch_conclusions} ties together the themes
developed within each of the prior chapters, summarizing the main
contributions of my research towards the field and describing planned
future areas of research.
